# Image Classifier using PyTorch

Welcome to our Image Classifier repository! This project provides a complete solution for training, validating, and utilizing neural networks to classify images using PyTorch.

## File Structure

- `models/simple_cnn.py`: Contains the architecture for a simple CNN model.
- `infer.py`: Code for making inferences using the trained model.
- `load_data.py`: Script for loading and preprocessing data.
- `loss.py`: Custom loss functions for model training.
- `train.py`: Main script for training the image classifier model.
- `train_iter.py`: Training loop iterations.

## Usage

- **Model Creation**: `models/simple_cnn.py` holds a basic CNN model structure. Modify or create your own model architecture here.
- **Training**: Use `train.py` to initiate model training. Customize with different datasets, hyperparameters, and more.
- **Inference**: `infer.py` provides a script to test and make predictions using the trained model.
- **Data Handling**: `load_data.py` is designed for data loading and preprocessing before training.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nivitus/PyTorch_Image_Classifier.git
